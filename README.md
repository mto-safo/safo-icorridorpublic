# safo-icorridorpublic
This repository hosts images and web code that are already publicly available online; intended for public facing iCorridor ArcGIS Hub. This repository does not contain any of the data that is hosted by iCorridor or the MTO ArcGIS Online Site.

The iCorridor site is a open data hub built on the ArcGIS Hub platform. The site is built with a hybrid of 'plug & play' elements provided by the ArcGIS Hub site builder, as well as custom HTML / CSS code. The site does not allow Javascript scripting. In order to implement custom HTML / CSS code a text box must be added from the site editor containing the code. This means that every element should have its own html code (as shown above in repository contents). CSS code is applied globally no matter where it is pasted in the site, therefore use of element IDs are recommended. 

When editing the site, it is important to note that preset CSS frameworks are prioritized and set by ArcGIS Hub on top of your own code (i.e. Bootstrap 3, Ember, Calcite Web). This means that custom CSS code will be overwritten unless you address it by its element ID name to increase its priority level. Custom elements are typically contained within an overarching DIV container with ID = "bootstrap-overrides".
